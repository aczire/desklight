# desklight
Set Windows spotlight image as desktop wallpaper.

Desklight will copy your Windows spotlight image on the lock screen as desktop background image.
Run `desklight.exe install` to create a task in Task Scheduler, with trigger "On workstation unlock", which ensures the desktop wallpaper is updated with lockscreen spotlight image whenever you login to your machine.

If there are multiple images available in the spotlight repository, a random image will be used as the desktop background.
So the desktop background will not neccesarily be the exact one as that of the lockscreen.

Feel free to contact in case of any issues.
